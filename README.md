<p>Free Fire is a single-player, competitive game. There are four types of weapons in the game: pistols, machine guns, sniper rifles, and rocket launchers.</p>
<p>Each weapon type has four levels of rate of fire. At the bottom, low level, rates of fire will probably take a couple of bullets to</p>
<p>kill an enemy. Up at the highest level, they will get killed instantly.</p>
<p>You can carry up to two guns at one time. If you start to run out of ammo for your primary gun, the secondary gun can be used to finish a fight in less than 10 seconds. You can swap between two guns in the middle of a fight.</p>

<p>A crosshair will appear at the bottom left of your vision when your aim is correct.</p>
<p>A crosshair will disappear when you miss. The crosshair will move around and become bigger/smaller to indicate how well you're hitting.</p>
<p>When an enemy is shot, it will start to bleed. Just like real life, you can heal the injured enemy by hitting them again or by shooting them in the head.</p>
<p>Teamwork is important. If you die, you&rsquo;re out. You have to go and search for teammates, as they can give you hints on where to go to find other players. You can shoot someone that&rsquo;s far away from you to go after them.</p>
<p>When you play Free Fire, it's up to you to do as much damage as possible. Or you can lie on the floor and play passively. Anything goes, but never get close to your opponent's health bar.</p>
